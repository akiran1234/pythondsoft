# Exception Handling.
# An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts
# .. the normal flow of the program's instructions.
# Handling those un expected exception/errors in the program is called Exception Handling.
# In python by using "try" and "except" block we can handle those exceptions with out interrupting the execution.
# try block:    Contains statements that may throw different types of exceptions hence multiple except blocks is required.
# except block: Will have a block of code that will be executed when that particular exception has raised.
# else block:   If there is not exception then else block will be executed. It means try block is executed successfully .
# finally:      This finally block will be executed regardless of exception has been raised or not. This block is used for clean up activities likes- closing the opened files
# .. disconnecting the db servers or remote servers.
# except Exception: block should be the last block of multiple except blocks since this will handle any sort of exceptions.
# All the exceptions are inherited from parent class (Exception Class) either directly or indirectly.
# All the exceptions in python are classes (ZeroDivisionError, ImportError,IOError, IndexError,AttributeError) and the super class/base class is Exception class.
# ZeroDivisionError --> This exception is raised when divided by Zero.
# ImportError       --> This is raised when the module that is getting imported is not found.
# IOError           --> This is raised when the file we are trying to open is not found.
# IndexError        --> When trying to access the index which is out of size.
# AttributeError    --> If the attribute is not found.
