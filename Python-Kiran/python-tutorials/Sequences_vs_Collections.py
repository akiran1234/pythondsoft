# Sequences Vs Collections 
# Refer
# Sequence: The order in which we put them in is the order in which we get an item out from them.
# 6 types of Sequence: String, list, tuples,range object,  Byte sequences and byte array.


# Collections(un ordered): In a collection, the order of the items is not in a sequence. The order of the items would vary randomly.  (But physically, they do have an order.)
# 2 types: Sets, Dictionaries.
# sequences are used for iterating the elements and collections are used to hold the stuff.

# check collections library  for ordered dictionary and other data structures.
